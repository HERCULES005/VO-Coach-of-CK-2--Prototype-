The screen displays a Visual Studio Code (VS Code) window with a Python script named `main_0.py` open. The script appears to define a class `OverlayWindow_2` with functions related to GUI elements for suggestion boxes, window colors, window switching, and clearing information from a textbox. The file explorer on the left shows other Python scripts and resources within the "VO Coach 2" project directory. The terminal at the bottom shows a command running this script using Python.
